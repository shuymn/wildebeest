## Getting started

Before we start you need to take note of your Zone and Account IDs. To find them, [login](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) into your account and select the zone (domain) where you plan to use Wildebeest. Then, on the **_Overview_** page you will see something like this:

![zone and account IDs](https://imagedelivery.net/NkfPDviynOyTAOI79ar_GQ/f595d8b7-6ce9-4ef7-7416-253efd012800/w=306)

Take note, you need this information later. Let's start the installation process.

Wildebeest uses [Deploy to Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/) to automate the installation process.

**Click here to start the installation.**

Please pay attention to all the steps involved in the installation process.

- Authorize Workers to use your GitHub account.
- Enter your **Account ID** (from the previous section)
- Press the **Create token** button first, to create it, it will redirect you to a token template with all the required permissions pre-configured. Then enter the **API token** in the form.
- Enter the **Zone ID**, **Domain**, **Title**, **Admin Email** and **Description** for your instance.
- Fork the repository into your personal GitHub account.
- Enable GitHub Actions.
- Deploy.

Here is each step again, with screenshots:

### Authorizations and API Token

The first steps are authorizing Workers to use your GitHub account and entering your **Account ID**, pressing the **Create token** button and pasting the token in the **API Token** field.

![deploy to workers](https://imagedelivery.net/NkfPDviynOyTAOI79ar_GQ/00d9a77c-440f-46e5-b2bf-ccd198815800/public)

### Instance configuration

Here we configure the instance/project with the **Zone ID**, **Domain** (the full FQDN domain of your zone, where you want to deploy your Wildebeest server), **Title**, **Admin Email** and **Description**.

![configure instance](https://imagedelivery.net/NkfPDviynOyTAOI79ar_GQ/8aa836c5-a8e1-4ea5-d55c-a678aafe0b00/public)

Now click **_Fork the repository_**.

Then enable GitHub Actions and confirm by clicking **_Workflows enabled_**.

And finally click **_Deploy_**.

![deploy](https://imagedelivery.net/NkfPDviynOyTAOI79ar_GQ/be02ef19-b38a-4aef-7591-37dde5161200/public)

The installation script will now build and deploy your project to Cloudflare Pages and will run a [Terraform script](https://github.com/cloudflare/wildebeest/blob/main/tf/main.tf) to configure D1, Workers, DNS, Images and Access settings automatically for you.

Make sure the deploy was successful by looking at the GitHub Actions logs. If it wasn't, take a look at errors, we did our best trying to make then clear.

## Finish installation

If you followed all the steps, you should see a successful GitHub Actions build.

![github actions secrets](https://imagedelivery.net/NkfPDviynOyTAOI79ar_GQ/2f00e3e4-aace-46f9-f0f4-eaeceb691a00/w=915)

You can also confirm in the Cloudflare [dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) that the Pages project, DNS entry, KV namespace, D1 database and Access rule were all created and configured.

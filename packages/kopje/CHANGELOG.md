# Changelog

All notable changes to the `kopje` package. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and versions follow [semver](https://semver.org). Before 1.0, a minor version may make breaking changes.

Each version says whether it changes the Store's schema (adds migrations) and whether an instance must change its
`wrangler.jsonc` (a binding, a compatibility date or flag). See [docs/upgrade.md](docs/upgrade.md).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The first release: the Mastodon API, ActivityPub federation, media, search, the `/setup` wizard, the daily
  encrypted backup and the `kopje-admin` CLI.
- The instance template (`deploy/` in the repository), with the Deploy to Cloudflare button.

### Instance changes

- Store schema: `0000_initial`.
- `wrangler.jsonc`: as in the template, compatibility date `2026-10-11`. Tested with wrangler 4.149.0.
